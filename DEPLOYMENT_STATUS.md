- **Deployment Scripts**: Created and tested
- **Verification**: Scripts provided
- **Status**: Deployed (addresses below)

## Files Created for Testnet Deployment

1. **`contracts/script/DeployTestnet.s.sol`** - Main deployment script
2. **`contracts/script/TestnetSetup.s.sol`** - Post-deployment setup script
3. **`contracts/script/DeployDemo.s.sol`** - Demo script showing deployment process
4. **`TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Comprehensive deployment guide
5. **`DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`** - This status document

## Next Steps for Full Testnet Deployment

To complete the testnet deployment (requires user action):

1. **Get Base Sepolia ETH**: Visit [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://bridge.base.org/deposit)
2. **Set environment variables**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
3. **Deploy contracts**: Run the deployment scripts
4. **Verify contracts**: Use the verification commands
5. **Update frontend**: Set the deployed contract addresses
6. **Test**: Verify the full flow works on testnet
